# FoodSaver – Project Vision & Impact

## Our Mission
**FoodSaver** bridges the gap between surplus food and those who need it most. We connect restaurants and food businesses with NGOs and community organizations to ensure that excess food reaches people instead of landfills.

## The Problem We're Solving
- **Food Waste Crisis**: Roughly 25-30% of all food produced globally (about 1.6 billion tons) is wasted annually, translating into approximately one billion meals wasted every day, while millions face hunger worldwide.
- **Environmental Impact**: Food waste accounts for approximately 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, contributing significantly to climate change.
- **Resource Inefficiency**: Food production uses vast resources, including land, water, and energy, which are wasted when food is discarded instead of consumed.

## Real-World Impact
✨ **Reduce Food Waste** – Saving surplus food reduces a massive environmental footprint and supports global sustainability efforts.  
🤝 **Fight Hunger** – Redirecting surplus food to NGOs helps serve communities facing food insecurity.  
🌱 **Environmental Sustainability** – Less food waste means lower carbon emissions and reduced strain on natural resources.  
💡 **Community Building** – Foster partnerships between restaurants, NGOs, and communities for social good.

## Who Benefits
- **Restaurants & Food Businesses**: Reduce waste, cut costs, gain tax benefits, and enhance community goodwill.
- **NGOs & Community Organizations**: Gain reliable access to quality food donations to serve people in need.
- **Communities**: Improved food security and nutrition by accessing surplus edible food.
- **Environment**: Reduced landfill waste and less greenhouse gas emissions, helping combat climate change.
